deftchain 0.17
demonstrating skill and intelligence

built on bitcoin 0.16
pow algorithm: balloon512 (with 5 variants, concurrently mineable; no per-algo daemon instances)
retarget algorithm: shortened and tuned dual_kgw3
block time: 4 minutes
block maturity: 30 blocks
block subsidy: 8.5 DEFT per block
emission decay: block reward halves every 150,000 blocks
emission simulation: included as 'deftreward.c'
coin marketcap: maximum of 3 million DEFT
coin swap: block 1 will contain X00,000 DEFT; which can be redeemed only by original users of the first deft release. coins present on the original chain, before height XX,000 will be accepted via crosschain transaction.
what it is

deftchain is an experimental digital currency, which allows users to roll out their own individual blockchain, by holding an unspent transaction of 2500 DEFT in their wallet, similar to a masternode collateral payment. the users blockchain will exist and function as long as the transaction is held; allowing the creation, storage or transmission of a users own currency.

why restart the chain

the original deft release was promoted as a cpu-mineable/gpu-resistant currency, where the original balloon cpu hashing algorithm (after widespread community gpu development), still managed to maintain a ratio of approx 1:4 (cpu/gpu) advantage. unfortunately an early oversight where both internal hashing/pow hashing algorithm were set to balloon caused poor wallet performance, potentially breaking the pub/private address pairing if a fork were introduced to remedy this error.

the opportunity was taken to 'harden' the pow algorithm and rectify the wallet's performance, with lessons learnt from a public release, as well as implementing the 'sidechain as a service' functionality paradigm.
